# portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio of 2023! 

This year i wanted to take the time to focus on implementing js elements to my portfolio. 
I didn't have a portfolio that i coded myself, because i was lazy to make one, so i just simply made one through a cms kinda website. 

We had to fetch the github api and extract information and our repositorys from the api. Although we just completed a course that tought us how to do it, i still find it tricky and difficult. So the challenge was to get information from the api and implement the info into my website. 
It was quite difficult and it took a lot of time, but i managed to get the information. 
For the first step it took me a whole week, so i didn't have time to work on my css. 
I feel like i could have done more during this week, but i just couldn't manage to get the api and extract information from the api. 

Will i be using this website?
yes i will use this website, i will ofcourse on the css and i will use this website as my work display page. Then i only have to work on the other elements on my portfolio. 
All in all it was really nice to work on my portfolio, I now have a base to work on my portfolio, in the upcoming vacation i will build my portfolio to apply to companies for my end internship.
